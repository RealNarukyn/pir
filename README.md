# Project & Motivation 🐱‍🏍✨

**PIR** stands for **Padel Indoor Rubi** and it's meant to be a Web Application _(with posibilites of going to mobile version in the future...)_ that enables regular and non-regular users of the Padel Indoor Rubi installations an easy way to **look** and **book** paddle tracks.

It'll enable the user to **unbook** the track in case you finally can't go playing so other users can book it.

Furthermore, it'll have a user register system that enables the logged users to post training offers _(if you're a personal trainer looking for some cash_ 🤑 _)_ or look for those good trainers if you want to improve your reverse serve 😎


## Why am I doing it?
Actually, already exists a [web](https://www.padelindoorrubi.com/#1) but yesterday I wanted to book a track to play with a friend and I was like:

![WTF](https://videohive.img.customer.envatousercontent.com/files/f0f6c61d-4a46-4f23-8e18-5c57cf7200e9/inline_image_preview.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&fit=crop&crop=top&max-h=8000&max-w=590&s=1234af1e409732026deae86b88e255f7)

Ok, I recognize it. I looked kinda boomer... but it looked to me a bit confusing so, I decided to create a better web application that enables me to book tracks.
